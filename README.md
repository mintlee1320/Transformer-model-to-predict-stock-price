# Transformer-model-to-predict-stock-price
The code has been referenced in various places.

I am just a student at NEU. And like many other students (maybe), I also have a passion for stocks. 
This will be my step-by-step process of learning stocks. Stocks require learning a lot of things such as stocks, bonds, financial reports, financial indicators,... 
But I will start small. Starting from predicting stocks. And this is what I have learned.

P/S: I will post more to show my learning process.
